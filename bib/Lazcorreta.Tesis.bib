@article{WangWong-FromAssociationToClassificationInferenceUsingWeightOfEvidence-2003,
	Abstract = {Association and classification are two important tasks in data mining and knowledge discovery. Intensive studies have been carried out in both areas. But, how to apply discovered event associations to classification is still seldom found in current publications. Trying to bridge this gap, this paper extends our previous paper on significant event association discovery to classification. We propose to use weight of evidence to evaluate the evidence of a significant event association in support of, or against, a certain class membership. Traditional weight of evidence in information theory is extended here to measure the event associations of different orders with respect to a certain class. After the discovery of significant event associations inherent in a data set, it is easy and efficient to apply the weight of evidence measure for classifying an observation according to any attribute. With this approach, we achieve flexible prediction.},

Es conciso y hace una comparativa de los modelos PPM (Prediction by Partial Match), LRS PPM (Longest Repeating Sequences \ldots) y PB PPM (Popularity-Based \ldots). Hacen hincapié en el poco uso de memoria principal con su modelo. Tiene otras ideas interesantes como la inclusión de imágenes en las sesiones si aquellas han sido solicitadas al menos 10 segundos después de la última página accedida por el usuario (ese lapso de tiempo permite pensar que no es una imagen adjunta). Categorizan la frecuencia de cada página (popularidad de la página) en 4 categorías, lo que les sirve para ponderar las páginas a la hora de ser tenidas en cuenta en las sugerencias. También se basan en la {\em probabilidad relativa de solicitar una URL}, cociente de dividir el número de accesos a esa URL entre el número de accesos a su predecesora en la sesión. Usa tres métricas para evaluar los modelos: {\em hit ratio} (también llamado aplicabilidad en \cite{SuYangLuZhang_WhatNext_00}), {\em traffic increment} (ratio entre bytes transmitidos y bytes útiles para el usuario, no lo acabo de comprender) y {\em space} (tamaño de la memoria empleada en el servidor para la predicción, parece que sólo habla de la memoria para el árbol de predicción).

Unlike the traditional $n$-gram model, in which the predicted action is taken as the ultimate goal and is only determined by its previous $n$ actions, our method predicts the next action that lies on the optimal path that leads to the ultimate goal. Experiments show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method can achieve up to 3.65\% (or about 11\% relative) improvement to the traditional one-step $n$-gram model.},

@inproceedings{SuYangLuZhang-WhatNext-2000,
	Abstract = {As an increasing number of users access information on the web, there is a great opportunity to learn from the server logs to learn about the users' probable actions in the future. In this paper, we present an $n$-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large data sets to predict the users' future requests. Since this is a prediction system, we cannot measure the recall in a traditional sense. We, therefore, present the notion of applicability to give a measure of the ability to predict the next document. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show for $n$-gram based prediction when $n$ is greater than three, we can increase precision by 20\% or more for two realistic web logs. Also we present an efficient method that can compress our model to 30\% of its original size so that the model can be loaded in main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web, including pre-sending, pre-fetching, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as web caching policies. Our tests are based on three realistic web logs. Our algorithm is implemented in a prediction system called WhatNext, which shows a marked improvement in precision and applicability over previous approaches.},

La observación de los resultados muestra que algunas de estas medidas aportan información redundante y abren la posibilidad de reducir el número de estas reglas mediante un análisis en componentes principales, donde con sólo dos componentes se explica el 90\% de la varianza aportada por nueve de las principales medidas propuestas en la literatura.

We introduce the problem of mining sequential patterns over such databases. We present three algorithms to solve this problem, and empirically evaluate their performance using synthetic data. Two of the proposed algorithms, AprioriSome and AprioriAll, have comparable performance, albeit AprioriSome performs a little better when the minimum number of customers that must support a sequential pattern is low. Scale-up experiments show that both AprioriSome and AprioriAll scale linearly with the number of customer transactions. They also have excellent scale-up properties with respect to the number of transactions per customer and the number of items in a transaction.},

	Abstract = {Search engines are the gateway for users to retrieve information from the Web. There is a crucial need for tools that allow effective analysis of search engine queries to provide a greater understanding of Web users' information seeking behavior. The objective of the study is to develop an effective strategy for the selection of samples from large-scale data sets. Millions of queries are submitted to Web search engines daily and new sampling techniques are required to bring these databases to a manageable size, while preserving the statistically representative characteristics of the entire data set. This paper reports results from a study using data logs from the Excite Web search engine. We use Poisson sampling to develop a sampling strategy, and show how sample sets selected by Poisson sampling statistically effectively represent the characteristics of the entire dataset. In addition, this paper discusses the use of Poisson sampling in continuous monitoring of stochastic processes, such as Web site dynamics.},

First, we formalize this problem as a clustering problem and introduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call cluster mining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space into disjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (and possibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, a cluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input and outputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we show experimentally that PageGather is both faster (by a factor of three) and more effective than traditional clustering algorithms on this task. Our experiment relies on access log collected over a month from an actual web site.},

	Abstract = {Rule induction research implicitly assumes that after producing the rules from a dataset, these rules will be used directly by an expert system or a human user. In real-life applications, the situation may not be as simple as that, particularly, when the user of the rules is a human being. The human user almost always has some previous concepts or knowledge about the domain represented by the dataset. Naturally, he/she wishes to know how the new rules compare with his/her existing knowledge. In dynamic domains where the rules may change over time, it is important to know what the changes are. These aspects of research have largely been ignored in the past. With the increasing use of machine learning techniques in practical applications such as data mining, this issue of post analysis of rules warrants greater emphasis and attention. In this paper, we propose a technique to deal with this problem. A system has been implemented to perform the post analysis of classification rules generated by systems such as C4.5. The proposed technique is general and highly interactive. It will be particularly useful in data mining and data analysis.},

The clustering problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem with the objective of minimizing the maximum cluster diameter among all clusters. In order to overcome issues related to computational complexity of the problem, we developed a heuristic approach that improves computational times dramatically without compromising from optimality in most of the cases that we tested. The performance of this approach is tested on a real problem. The analysis of our results indicates that our approach is computationally efficient and creates meaningful segmentation of data.},

@article{KhanmohammadiChou-GMMBDiscretizationAlgorithmForAssociativeClassificationofMedicalData-2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Knowledge-based systems such as expert systems are of particular interest in medical applications as extracted if-then rules can provide interpretable results. Various rule induction algorithms have been proposed to effectively extract knowledge from data, and they can be combined with classification methods to form rule-based classifiers. However, most of the rule-based classifiers can not directly handle numerical data such as blood pressure. A data preprocessing step called discretization is required to convert such numerical data into a categorical format. Existing discretization algorithms do not take into account the multimodal class densities of numerical variables in datasets, which may degrade the performance of rule-based classifiers. In this paper, a new Gaussian Mixture Model based Discretization Algorithm (GMBD) is proposed that preserve the most frequent patterns of the original dataset by taking into account the multimodal distribution of the numerical variables. The effectiveness of \{GMBD\} algorithm was verified using six publicly available medical datasets. According to the experimental results, the \{GMBD\} algorithm outperformed five other static discretization methods in terms of the number of generated rules and classification accuracy in the associative classification algorithm. Consequently, our proposed approach has a potential to enhance the performance of rule-based classifiers used in clinical expert systems. },

	Abstract = {Association rule mining and classification are important tasks in data mining. Using association rules has proved to be a good approach for classification. In this paper, we propose an accurate classifier based on class association rules (CARs), called CAR-IC, which introduces a new pruning strategy for mining CARs, which allows building specific rules with high confidence. Moreover, we propose and prove three propositions that support the use of a confidence threshold for computing rules that avoids ambiguity at the classification stage. This paper also presents a new way for ordering the set of \{CARs\} based on rule size and confidence. Finally, we define a new coverage strategy, which reduces the number of non-covered unseen-transactions during the classification stage. Results over several datasets show that CAR-IC beats the best classifiers based on \{CARs\} reported in the literature. },

@inproceedings{YinHan-CPARClassificationBasedOnPredictiveAR-2003,
	Abstract = {Recent studies in data mining have proposed a new classification approach, called associative classification, which, according to several reports, such as [7, 6], achieves higher classification accuracy than traditional classification approaches such as C4.5. However, the approach also suffers from two major deficiencies: (1) it generates a very large number of association rules, which leads to high processing overhead; and (2) its confidence-based rule evaluation measure may lead to overfitting.

In comparison with associative classification, traditional rule-based classifiers, such as C4.5, FOIL and RIPPER, are substantially faster but their accuracy, in most cases, may not be as high. In this paper, we propose a new classification approach, CPAR (Classification based on Predictive Association Rules), which combines the advantages of both associative classification and traditional rule-based classification. Instead of generating a large number of candidate rules as in associative classification, CPAR adopts a greedy algorithm to generate rules directly from training data. Moreover, CPAR generates and tests more rules than traditional rule-based classifiers to avoid missing important rules. To avoid overfitting, CPAR uses expected accuracy to evaluate each rule and uses the best k rules in prediction.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured data. However, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification is based on only single high-confidence rule.

In this study, we propose a new associative classification method, CMAR, i.e., Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large database efficiently. Moreover, it applies a CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on a weighted $\chi^2$ analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from UCI machine learning database repository show that CMAR is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with CBA and C4.5. Moreover, our performance study shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods.},

	Abstract = {Most of the data mining algorithm focuses on frequent patterns, few algorithm emphases on rare items, but rare items [1] also have importance, for example, network intrusion detection, where among various normal connections we need to detect the rare malicious connections. Classification of such a non-uniform data set is a challenging issue. Most classifiers perform poorly in such a data set. Realizing the importance of rare class classification, in this paper we propose a classification algorithm (CBMR Algorithm) that is based on association rules mined by MSApriori approach [2] and is capable of classifying rare classes. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been done for different data sets [3] and in comparison with existing technique like [4], it is found that algorithm has efficient and superior performance for classifying rare cases.},

@article{ParkChenYu-UsingAHashBasedMethod-1997,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. Mining association rules means that given a database of sales transactions, to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in a transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively for each large $k$-itemset in increasing order of $k$ where a large $k$-itemset is a large itemset with $k$ items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation. It is a hash based algorithm and is especially effective for the generation of candidate set for large 2-itemsets. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in order of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. The advantage of the proposed algorithm also provides us an opportunity of reducing the amount of disk I/O required. Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.},

This paper considers a problem that to the best of our knowledge has not been addressed, namely, how to mine non-derivable frequent itemsets in an incremental fashion. We design a compact data structure named NDFIT to efficiently maintain a dynamically selected set of itemsets. In NDFIT, the nodes are divided into four categories to reduce the redundant computational cost based on their properties. Consequently, an optimized algorithm named NDFIoDS is proposed to generate non-derivable frequent itemsets over stream sliding window. Our experimental results show that this method is effective and more efficient than previous approaches.},

@phdthesis{Liu-SupportingEfficientAndScalableFrequentPatternMining-2005,
	Abstract = {With the large amount of data collected in various applications, data mining has become an essential tool for data analysis and decision support. Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area with a wide range of applications. In this dissertation, we investigate several techniques to support efficient and scalable frequent itemset mining.
We first identify the key factors of a frequent itemset mining algorithm, and propose an algorithm AFOPT for efficient mining of frequent itemsets. The AFOPT algorithm adopts the pattern growth approach. It uses a new structure, called Ascending Frequency Ordered Prefix-Tree (or AFOPT for short), and two other structures to store conditional databases. An adaptive strategy is employed to choose proper structures according to the density of the conditional databases, which makes the AFOPT algorithm perform well on both sparse and dense databases.
To deal with very large databases with millions of transactions, we propose a Search Space based Partitioning approach SSP for scalable out-of-core mining. The novel idea of SSP is to partition the database based on the search space. Different partitions share data but not frequents itemsets. As such, frequent itemsets can be mined from each partition without the need to scan the whole database to verify their support. Furthermore, techniques are developed so that the available memory can be utilized during the mining process to minimize disk I/O. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithms achieve significant performance improvement over existing out-of-core mining algorithms.
Many decision support systems need to support online interactive frequent itemset mining, which is very challenging because frequent itemset mining is a computation intensive repetitive process. We propose a compact disk-based data structure CFP-tree (Condensed Frequent Pattern tree) for storing precomputed frequent itemsets to support online mining requests. Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets and association rules from a CFP-tree, as well as efficien algorithms to construct and update a CFP-tree, are developed. One obstacle to online association rule mining is the undesirably large result size. We introduce the concepto of frequent itemset class and the class association rule to reduce the result size without information loss. The benefits of organizing itemsets into classes are two-fold. On the one hand, the output size is reduced and is easier for users to browse the results. On the other hand, the computation cost is saved because the rule generation cost of the itemsets in the same class is shared. Our performance study demonstrates that with CFP-tree and the concept of frequent itemset class, frequent itemset and association rule mining request can be responded to promptly.},

First, the CDAR method creates some clusters by reading the database only once, and then clustering the transaction records to the $k$th cluster, where the length of a record is $k$. Then, the large $k$-itemsets are generated by contrasts with the $k$th cluster only, unlike the combination concept that contrasts with the entire database.

	Abstract = {Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based mining paradigm in the context of frequent itemsets, associations, correlations, sequential patterns, and many other interesting patterns in large databases. Constraint pushing techniques have been developed for mining frequent patterns and associations with antimonotonic, monotonic, and succinct constraints. In this paper, we study constraints which cannot be handled with existing theory and techniques in frequent pattern mining. For example, $avg(S)\theta v$, $median(S)\theta v$, $sum(S)\theta v$ ($S$ can contain items of arbitrary values, $\theta \in\{>,<,\leq,\geq\}$ and $v$ is a real number) are customarily regarded as ``tough'' constraints in that they cannot be pushed inside an algorithm such as Apriori. We develop a notion of convertible constraints and systematically analyze, classify, and characterize this class. We also develop techniques which enable them to be readily pushed deep inside the recently developed FP-growth algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Results from our detailed experiments show the effectiveness of the techniques developed.},

While many algorithms for pattern discovery have been developed, relatively little work has been reported on mining dynamic databases, a major area of application in this field. In this paper, a new algorithm, namely the Efficient Dynamic Database Updating Algorithm (EDUA), is designed for mining dynamic databases. It works well when data deletion is carried out in any subset of a database that is partitioned according to the arrival time of the data. A pruning technique is proposed for improving the efficiency of the EDUA algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach and it is demonstrated that the EDUA is efficient.},

@phdthesis{Meretakis-AUnifiedViewOnAssociationAndClassificationMining-2002,
	Abstract = {Association and classification mining have long been considered as separate research and application areas. The starting point in this thesis is the observation of some key underlying similarities between these two apparently different areas. This observation makes possible the study of well-known classification techniques from an association mining perspective. This different perspective may enable a better understanding of the classification algorithms and help in devising improved or hybrid versions by combining elements from areas that would otherwise be considered incompatible. Our work on building local Bayesian classifiers from itemsets discovered with association mining methods is a result of this different perspective. A new classifier LB, or Local Bayes, is proposed in our work and we show that it is very competitive against established and state of the art classification methods. In addition, LB shows how this different perspective in looking at classification methods can lead to concrete algorithms with superior performance.
Text classification is one of the traditional areas for the application of Machine Learning and Data Mining methods. While traditional classification algorithms have successfully been used for text classification, text collections are particularly suitable for association mining. This is because they usually contain hundreds or thousands of features (for example words) and these features tend to appear in text documents with certain dependencies. Moreover, these dependencies tend to appear locally and for a specific context and the content of words tends to change according to this context. The words “association” and “mining”, for example, express different notions when used separately than the expression “association mining”. Based on this observation we investigate the applicability of our context-specific classifier called LB in the domain of text classification. Our results are competitive with the most established text classification methods and our approach presents certain advantages, such as a good trade off between accuracy and scalability.
Facing the particular challenges of the text classification problem, we also propose a new text preprocessing method that simultaneously performs both feature and instance selection. This intuitive method is computationally efficient and, most importantly, our experimental results show that it produces outstanding results.

In this paper, we present sound and complete deduction rules to derive bounds on the support of an itemset. Based on these deduction rules, we construct a condensed representation of all frequent itemsets, by removing those itemsets for which the support can be derived, resulting in the so called Non-Derivable Itemsets (NDI) representation. We also present connections between our proposal and recent other proposals for condensed representations of frequent itemsets. Experiments on real-life datasets show the eectiveness of the NDI representation, making the search for frequent non-derivable itemsets a useful and tractable alternative to mining all frequent itemsets.},

	Abstract = {The most computationally demanding aspect of Association Rule Mining is the identification and counting of support of the frequent sets of items that occur together sufficiently often to be the basis of potentially interesting rules. The task increases in difficulty with the scale of the data and also with its density. The greatest challenge is posed by data that is too large to be contained in primary memory, especially when high data density and/or low support thresholds give rise to very large numbers of candidates that must be counted. In this paper, we consider strategies for partitioning the data to deal effectively with such cases. We describe a partitioning approach which organises the data into tree structures that can be processed independently. We present experimental results that show the method scales well for increasing dimensions of data and performs significantly better than alternatives, especially when dealing with dense data and low support thresholds.},

We argue that we need to search all the search space of candidate itemsets but rather let the database unveil its secrets as the customers use it.

	Abstract = {The continuous growth in the size and use of the World Wide Web is creating difficulties in both the design of web sites to suit a variety of different users and in the navigation through very large web structures of pages and links. We propose a data mining model that captures the user navigation behaviour patterns. The set of user navigation sessions, which characterize the interaction with the web pages visited, are modelled as a hypertext probabilistic grammar, whose higher probability generated strings correspond to the user's preferred trails. An algorithm to efficiently mine such trails is given. We make use of the $N$-grammar model which assumes that, when the user is browsing a given page, the last $N$ pages browsed affect the probability of the next page to be visited. The model is based on the well established theory of probabilistic grammars providing it with a sound theoretical foundation for future enhancements. Moreover, we propose the use of entropy as an estimator of the statistical properties of the grammar. Extensive experiments with both real and random data were conducted and the results show that, in practice, our algorithm runs in linear time in the size of the grammar. Our experiments also show that the entropy of the grammar is a good estimator of the number of mined trails and the results from the experiments with the real data confirm the effectiveness of our model.},

@phdthesis{Anderson-AMachineLearningApproachToWebPersonalization-2002,
	Abstract = {Most web sites today are designed one-size-fits-all: all visitors see the exact same pages regardless of interests, previous interactions, or, frequently, even browsing client (desktop PC or wireless PDA). But one size often does not fit all. Instead of presenting the same content, the web experience should be dynamic and personalized, adapting to visitors' preferences as evinced in previous interactions.\\ This thesis proposes a framework for personalizing the web experience. Within our PROTEUS framework, we view personalization as a two-step process of first modeling users, and then improving the site given the model. We frame this problem as a machine learning task: the goal is to predict users' web navigation given their previous behavior. We explore several means of personalization, including improving the wireless web and building personalized, dynamic portals, and concentrate on one in particular-automatically adding shortcuts to likely navigation destinations.\\ A challenge in modeling web navigation is that training data for an entire site may be plentiful, but sparse for any individual page. This difficulty can be overcome, however, by noting that most large web sites have a rich underlying relational structure that can be exploited for generalization: pages can belong to different types (e.g., pages about laptop computers versus pages about printers), with each type described by a different set of attributes (e.g., size of display versus printing speed).},

	Abstract = {This article considers the question: is effective Web mining possible?\\ Skeptics believe that the Web is too unstructured for Web mining to succeed. Indeed, data mining has been applied to databases traditionally, yet much of the information on the Web lies buried in documents designed for human consumption such as home pages or product catalogs. Furthermore, much of the information on the Web is presented in natural language text with no machine-readable semantics; HTML annotations structure the {\em display} of Web pages, but provide little insight into their {\em content}.\\ Some have advocated transforming the Web into a massive layered database to facilitate data mining [12], but the Web is too dynamic and chaotic to be tamed in this manner. Others have attempted to hand code site-specific ``wrappers'' that facilitate the extraction of information from individual Web resources (e.g., [8]). Hand coding is convenient but cannot keep up with the explosive growth of the Web. As an alternative, this article argues for the:\\ \textbf{Structured Web Hypothesis:} {\em Information on the Web is sufficiently structured to facilitate effective Web mining.} \ldots},

	Abstract = {Data Mining is used to discover patterns and relationships in data, with an emphasis on large observational data bases. It sits at the common frontiers of several fields including Data Base Management, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Data Visualization. From a statistical perspective it can be viewed as computer automated exploratory data analysis of (usually) large complex data sets. In spite of (or perhaps because of) the somewhat exaggerated hype, this field is having a major impact in business, industry, and science. It also affords enormous research opportunities for new methodological developments. Despite the obvious connections between data mining and statistical data analysis, most of the methodologies used in Data Mining have so far originated in fields other than Statistics. This paper explores some of the reasons for this, and why statisticians should have an interest in Data Mining. It is argued that Statistics can potentially have a major influence on Data Mining, but in order to do so some of our basic paradigms and operating principles may have to be modified.},

@article{ThabtahCowlingHammoud-ImprovingRuleSorting-2006,
	Abstract = {Traditional classification techniques such as decision trees and RIPPER use heuristic search methods to find a small subset of patterns. In recent years, a promising new approach that mainly uses association rule mining in classification called associative classification has been proposed. Most associative classification algorithms adopt the exhaustive search method presented in the famous Apriori algorithm to discover the rules and require multiple passes over the database. Furthermore, they find frequent items in one phase and generate the rules in a separate phase consuming more resources such as storage and processing time. In this paper, a new associative classification method called Multi-class Classification based on Association Rules (MCAR) is presented. MCAR takes advantage of vertical format representation and uses an efficient technique for discovering frequent items based on recursively intersecting the frequent items of size n to find potential frequent items of size nC1. Moreover, since rule ranking plays an important role in classification and the majority of the current associative classifiers like CBA and CMAR select rules mainly in terms of their confidence levels. MCAR aims to improve upon CBA and CMAR approaches by adding a more tie breaking constraints in order to limit random selection. Finally we show that shuffling the training data objects before mining can impact substantially the prediction power of some well known associative classification techniques. After experimentation with 20 different data sets, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in term of an error rate and efficiency if compared with decision trees, rule induction methods and other popular associative classification methods. Finally, we show the effectiveness of MCAR rule sorting method on the quality of the produced classifiers for 12 highly dense benchmark problems.},

@inproceedings{LeeStolfoMok-MiningAuditDataToBuildIntrusionDetectionModels-1998,
	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss a data mining framework for constructing intrusion detection models. The key ideas are to mine system audit data for consistent and useful patterns of program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features presented in the patterns to compute (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Our past experiments showed that classifiers can be used to detect intrusions, provided that sufficient audit data is available for training and the right set of system features are selected. We propose to use the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the audit data gathering and feature selection processes. We modify these two basic algorithms to use axis attribute(s) as a form of item constraints to compute only the relevant (useful) patterns, and an iterative level-wise approximate mining procedure to uncover the low frequency (but important) patternss. We report our experiments in using these algorithms on real-world audit data.},

@techreport{KiranReddy-ImprovedMultipleMSBasedAppMineRareAR-2009,
	Abstract = {In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract rare association rules. Rare association rules are the association rules containing rare items. Rare items are less frequent items. For extracting rare itemsets, the single minimum support (minsup) based approaches like Apriori approach suffer from rare item problem dilemma. At high minsup value, rare itemsets are missed, and at low minsup value, the number of frequent itemsets explodes. To extract rare itemsets, an effort has been made in the literature in which minsup of each item is fixed equal to the percentage of its support. Even though this approach improves the performance over single minsup based approaches, it still suffers from rare item problem dilemma. If minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value high, the rare itemsets are missed as the minsup for the rare items becomes close to their support, and if minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value low, the number of frequent itemsets explodes. In this paper, we propose an improved approach in which minsup is fixed for each item based on the notion of support difference. The proposed approach assigns appropriate minsup values for frequent as well as rare items based on their item supports and reduces both rule missing and rule explosion problems. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed approach improves performance over existing approaches by minimizing the explosion of number of frequent itemsets involving frequent items and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items.},

Earlier work on generalized association rules confined the minimum supports to be uniformly specified for all items or for items within the same taxonomy level. This constraint on minimum support would restrain an expert from discovering some deviations or exceptions that are more interesting but much less supported than general trends. In this paper, we extended the scope of mining generalized association rules in the presence of taxonomies to allow any form of user-specified multiple minimum supports. We discuss the problems of using classic Apriori itemset generation and presented two algorithms, MMS\_Cumulate and MMS\_Stratify, for discovering the generalized frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluation showed that these two algorithms are very effective and have good linear scale-up characteristics.},

@article{HuChen-MiningARwithMMS-2006,
	Abstract = {Mining association rules with multiple minimum supports is an important generalization of the association-rule-mining problem, which was recently proposed by Liu et al. Instead of setting a single minimum support threshold for all items, they allow users to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items, and an Apriori-based algorithm, named MSapriori, is developed to mine all frequent itemsets. In this paper, we study the same problem but with two additional improvements. First, we propose a FP-tree-like structure, MIS-tree, to store the crucial information about frequent patterns. Accordingly, an efficient MIS-tree-based algorithm, called the CFP-growth algorithm, is developed for mining all frequent itemsets. Second, since each item can have its own minimum support, it is very difficult for users to set the appropriate thresholds for all items at a time. In practice, users need to tune items' supports and run the mining algorithm repeatedly until a satisfactory end is reached. To speed up this time-consuming tuning process, an efficient algorithm which can maintain the MIS-tree structure without rescanning database is proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show that our algorithms are much more efficient and scalable than the previous algorithm.},

Such a large number of rules makes the algorithms inefficient and makes it difficult for the end users to comprehend the discovered rules. We present the concept of a heavy itemset. An itemset $A$ is heavy (for given support and confidence values) if all possible association rules made up of items only in $A$ are present. We prove a simple necessary and sufficient condition for an itemset to be heavy. We present a formula for the number of possible rules for a given heavy itemset, and show that a heavy itemset compactly represents an exponential number of association rules. Along with two simple search algorithms, we present an efficient greedy algorithm to generate a collection of disjoint heavy itemsets in a given transaction database. We then present a modified apriori algorithm that starts with a given collection of disjoint heavy itemsets and discovers more heavy itemsets, not necessarily disjoint with the given ones.},

@inproceedings{LiuHsuMa-ARMWithMultipleMS-1999,
	Abstract = {Association rule mining is an important model in data mining. Its mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls the minimum number of data cases that a rule must cover. Minconf controls the predictive strength of the rule. Since only one minsup is used for the whole database, the model implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the data. This is, however, seldom the case in reallife applications. In many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. If minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low. This may cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways. This dilemma is called the rare item problem. This paper proposes a novel technique to solve this problem. The technique allows the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items and their varied frequencies in the database. In rule mining, different rules may need to satisfy different minimum supports depending on what items are in the rules. Experiment results show that the technique is very effective.},

	Abstract = {In this paper a new method towards automatic personalized recommendation based on the behavior of a single user in accordance with all other users in web-based information systems is introduced. The proposal applies a modified version of the well-known Apriori data mining algorithm to the log files of a web site (primarily, an e-commerce or an e-learning site) to help the users to the selection of the best user-tailored links. The paper mainly analyzes the process of discovering association rules in this kind of big repositories and of transforming them into user-adapted recommendations by the two-step modified Apriori technique, which may be described as follows. A first pass of the modified Apriori algorithm verifies the existence of association rules in order to obtain a new repository of transactions that reflect the observed rules. A second pass of the proposed Apriori mechanism aims in discovering the rules that are really inter-associated. This way the behavior of a user is not determined by ``what he does'' but by ``how he does''. Furthermore, an efficient implementation has been performed to obtain results in real-time. As soon as a user closes his session in the web system, all data are recalculated to take the recent interaction into account for the next recommendations. Early results have shown that it is possible to run this model in web sites of medium size. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We illustrate our ideas by investigating the use of a dbms for a well-researched area: the discovery of association rules. We present a simple algorithm, consisting of only union and intersection operations, and show that it achieves quite good performance on an efficient dbms.

Our method can incorporate inheritance hierarchies to the association rule algorithm easily. We also present a technique that effectively reduces the number of database operations when searching large search spaces that contain only few interesting items.

Our work shows that database techniques are promising for data mining: general architectures can achieve reasonable results.},

Algorithm SETM uses only simple database primitives, viz., sorting and merge-scan join. Algorithm SETM is simple, fast, and stable over the mnge of pammeter values. The major contribution of this paper is that it shows that at least some aspects of data mining can be carried out by using general query languages such as SQL, mther than by developing specialized black box algorithms.

Given a sequence of itemsets, we have to find itemsets that are contained as a subset in more than a given number of elements of the sequence. More than 180 papers have been published about algorithms to solve this task, most of them declared to be the most efficient. The open-source competition, wich was organized ten years after the problem's birth, proved that the truth is far from the claims and the data structure and implementation issues need to be polished even for the basic algorithms.\\ In this survey we investigate data structure and implementation details of the three most important FIM algorithms Apirori, Eclat, FP-growth, examine their advantages and disavantages. Besides, we present new techniques to speed-up the basic algorithms.},

	Abstract = {The efficiency of frequent itemset mining algorithms is determined mainly by three factors: the way candidates are generated, the data structure that is used and the implementation details. Most papers focus on the first factor, some describe the underlying data structures, but implementation details are almost always neglected. In this paper we show that the effect of implementation can be more important than the selection of the algorithm. Ideas that seem to be quite promising, may turn out to be ineffective if we descend to the implementation level.\\ We theoretically and experimentally analyze APRIORI which is the most established algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Several implementations of the algorithm have been put forward in the last decade. Although they are implementations of the very same algorithm, they display large differences in running time and memory need. In this paper we describe an implementation of APRIORI that outperforms all implementations known to us. We analyze, theoretically and experimentally, the principal data structure of our solution. This data structure is the main factor in the efficiency of our implementation. Moreover, we present a simple modification of APRIORI that appears to be faster than the original algorithm.},

@article{TsayHsuYu-FIUTaNewMethodForFIM-2009,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient method, the frequent items ultrametric trees (FIUT), for mining frequent itemsets in a database. FIUT uses a special frequent items ultrametric tree (FIU-tree) structure to enhance its efficiency in obtaining frequent itemsets. Compared to related work, FIUT has four major advantages. First, it minimizes I/O overhead by scanning the database only twice. Second, the FIU-tree is an improved way to partition a database, which results from clustering transactions, and significantly reduces the search space. Third, only frequent items in each transaction are inserted as nodes into the FIU-tree for compressed storage. Finally, all frequent itemsets are generated by checking the leaves of each FIU-tree, without traversing the tree recursively, which significantly reduces computing time. FIUT was compared with FP-growth, a well-known and widely used algorithm, and the simulation results showed that the FIUT outperforms the FP-growth. In addition, further extensions of this approach and their implications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Multi-core processors are proliferated across different domains in recent years. In this paper, we study the performance of frequent pattern mining on a modern multi-core machine. A detailed study shows that, even with the best implementation, current FP-tree based algorithms still under-utilize a multi-core system due to poor data locality and insufficient parallelism expression. We propose two techniques: a cache-conscious FP-array (frequent pattern array) and a lock-free dataset tiling parallelization mechanism to address this problem. The FP-array efficiently improves the data locality performance, and makes use of the benefits from hardware and software prefetching. The result yields an overall 4.0 speedup compared with the state-of-the-art implementation. Furthermore, to unlock the power of multi-core processor, a lock-free parallelization approach is proposed to restructure the FP-tree building algorithm. It not only eliminates the locks in building a single FP-tree with fine-grained threads, but also improves the temporal data locality performance. To summarize, with the proposed cache-conscious FP-array and lock-free parallelization enhancements, the overall FP-tree algorithm achieves a 24 fold speedup on an 8-core machine. Finally, we believe the presented techniques can be applied to other data mining tasks as well with the prevalence of multi-core processor.},

@article{LiuLuYu-CFPtreeCompactDiskBasedStructureForStoringAndQueryingFI-2007,
	Abstract = {Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area with a wide range of applications. Many decision support systems need to support online interactive frequent itemset mining, which is a challenging task because frequent itemset mining is a computation intensive repetitive process. One solution is to precompute frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose a compact disk-based data structure--CFP-tree to store precomputed frequent itemsets on a disk to support online mining requests. The CFP-tree structure effectively utilizes the redundancy in frequent itemsets to save space. The compressing ratio of a CFP-tree can be as high as several thousands or even higher. Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets from a CFP-tree, as well as efficient algorithms to construct and maintain a CFP-tree, are developed. Our performance study demonstrates that with a CFP-tree, frequent itemset mining requests can be responded to promptly.},

@article{HongKuoWang-FuzzyAprioriTID-2004,
	Abstract = {Due to the increasing use of very large databases and data warehouses, mining useful information and helpful knowledge from transactions is evolving into an important research area. Most of conventional data mining algorithms identify the relation among transactions with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real world applications. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm based on the Apriori approach to explore interesting knowledge from the transactions with quantitative values. This paper proposes another new fuzzy mining algorithm based on the AprioriTid approach to find fuzzy association rules from given quantitative transactions. Each item uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes, thus making the number of fuzzy regions to be processed the same as that of the original items. The algorithm therefore focuses on the most important linguistic terms for reduced time complexity. Experimental results from the data in a supermarket of a department store show the feasibility of the proposed mining algorithm.},

@article{LinKedem-PincerSearchFIM-2002,
	Abstract = {Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up, breadth-first search direction. The computation starts from frequent 1-itemsets (the minimum length frequent itemsets) and continues until all maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform well when all maximal frequent itemsets are short. However, performance drastically deteriorates when some of the maximal frequent itemsets are long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up and the top-down searches. The primary search direction is still bottom-up, but a restricted search is also conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating a new data structure, the maximum frequent candidate set. It is used to prune early candidates that would be normally encountered in the bottom-up search. A very important characteristic of the algorithm is that it does not require explicit examination of every frequent itemset. Therefore, the algorithm performs well even when some maximal frequent itemsets are long. As its output, the algorithm produces the maximum frequent set, i.e., the set containing all the maximal frequent itemsets, thus specifying inmediately all frequent itemsets.We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using well-known synthetic benchmark databases, real-life census, and stock market databases. The improvement in performance can be up to several orders of magnitude, compared to the best previous algorithms.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in transaction databases. The basic idea of our algorithm is inspired from the Direct Hashing and Pruning (DHP) algorithm, which is in fact a variation of the well-known Apriori algorithm. In the DHP algorithm, a hash table is used in order to reduce the size of the candidate $k+1$ itemsets generated at each step. The difference of our algorithm is that, it uses perfect hashing in order to create a hash table for the candidate $k+1$ itemsets. As perfect hashing is used, the hash table contains the actual counts of the candidate $k+1$ itemsets. Hence we do not need to make extra processing to count the occurrences of candidate $k+1$ itemsets as in the DHP algorithm. The algorithm also prunes the database at each step in order to reduce the search space. We also tested our algorithm with real datasets obtained from a large retailing company and observed that our algorithm performs better than the Apriori algorithm.},

@inproceedings{HanPeiYin-MiningFrequentPatternsWithoutCandidateGeneration-2000,
	Abstract = {Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases, time-series databases, and many other kinds of databases has been studied popularly in data mining research. Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist a large number of patterns and/or long patterns. In this study, we propose a novel frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree- based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a condensed, smaller data structure, FP-tree which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern-fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent-pattern mining methods},

The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented, which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques. The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) database only once, addressing the open question in association mining, whether all the rules can be efficiently extracted in a single database pass. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the problem of mining generalized association rules. Given a large database of transactions, where each transaction consists of a set of items, and a taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) on the items, we find associations between items at any level of the taxonomy. For example, given a taxonomy that says that jackets is-a outerwear is-a clothes, we may infer a rule that ``people who buy outerwear tend to buy shoes''. This rule may hold even if rules that ``people who buy jackets tend to buy shoes'', and ``people who buy clothes tend to buy shoes'' do not hold. An obvious solution to the problem is to add all ancestors of each item in a transaction to the transaction, and then run any of the algorithms for mining association rules on these ``extended transactions''. However, this ``Basic'' algorithm is not very fast; we present two algorithms, Cumulate and EstMerge, which run 2 to 5 times faster than Basic (and more than 100 times faster on one real-life dataset). We also present a new interest-measure for rules which uses the information in the taxonomy. Given a user-specified ``minimum-interest-level'', this measure prunes a large number of redudant rules; 40\% to 60\% of all the rules were pruned on two real-life datasets.},

	Abstract = {Discovery of association rules is an important database mining problem. Current algorithms for finding association rules require several passes over the analyzed database, and obviously the role of I/O overhead is very significant for very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce the database activity considerably. The idea is to pick a random sample, to find using this sample all association rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then to verify the results with the rest of the database. The algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, probabilistic, and in those rare cases where our sampling method does not produce all association rules, the missing rules can be found in a second pass. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find association rules very efficiently in only one database pass.},

In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for mining association rules that is fundamentally different from known algorithms. Compared to the previous algorithms, our algorithm reduces both CPU and I/O overheads. In our experimental study it was found that for large databases, the CPU overhead was reduced by as much as a factor of seven and I/O was reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Hence this algorithm is especially suitable for very large size databases. The algorithm is also ideally suited for parallelization.

@article{ParkChenYu-AnEffectiveHashBasedAlgorithmForARM-1995,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in a large database of sales transactions. The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first and then, identifying, within this candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k where a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we propose an effective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly. Extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Mining frequent itemsets in transaction databases, time-series databases and many other kinds of databases is an important task and has been studied popularly in data mining research. The problem of mining frequent itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first, and then, identifying those itemsets that meet the frequent itemset requirement within this candidate set. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on pruning to reduce the candidate itemsets amounts and the times of scanning databases. However, many algorithms adopt an Apriori-like candidate itemsets generation and support count approach that is the most time-wasted process. To address this issue, the paper proposes an effective algorithm named as BitTableFI. In the algorithm, a special data structure BitTable is used horizontally and vertically to compress database for quick candidate itemsets generation and support count, respectively. The algorithm can also be used in many Apriori-like algorithms to improve the performance. Experiments with both synthetic and real databases show that BitTableFI outperforms Apriori and CBAR which uses ClusterTable for quick support count.},

	Abstract = {We present our perspective of database mining as the confluence of machine learning techniques and the performance emphasis of database technology. We describe three classes of database mining problems involving classification, associations, and sequences, and argue that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive data. We describe a model and some basic operations for the process of rule discovery. We show how the database mining problems we consider map to this model and how they can be solved by using the basic operations we propose. We give an example of an algorithm for classification obtained by combining the basic rule discovery operations. This algorithm not only is efficient in discovering classification rules but also has accuracy comparable to ID3, one of the current best classifiers.},

	Abstract = {Classification rule mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the database that forms an accurate classifier. Association rule mining finds all the rules existing in the database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. For association rule mining, the target of discovery is not pre-determined, while for classification rule mining there is one and only one predetermined target. In this paper, we propose to integrate these two mining techniques. The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs). An efficient algorithm is also given for building a classifier based on the set of discovered CARs. Experimental results show that the classifier built this way is, in general, more accurate than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5. In addition, this integration helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems.},

This data set includes descripitons of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the posionous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be’’ for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.},
